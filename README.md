# Designing Data Intensive Applications Notes
This repository serves as a collection of my own notes and summaries for studying and understanding the concepts covered in the book.

## About the Book
"Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann is a highly regarded resource for developers, engineers, and architects working with data-intensive systems. The book explores the principles, patterns, and best practices for designing and building robust, scalable, and reliable applications that process and store large volumes of data.

The book is available [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063).
